Imagine a few years into the future when we can have virtual reality sunglasses that fit in our pockets. You could put on your sunglasses and instantly be immersed in a whole other environment optimized for your work. Turning your physical head to the side allows you to change your view and see more of the environment. You could pick up a virtual piece of paper off of the ground by actually moving your physical arms. We would like your help to tell us what problems could be solved using such a future virtual reality environment."
